### Question 1. 
**Talk about a pleasant and memorable event that happened while you were in school. Explain why this event brings back fond memories.**

Answer (Preparation Time: 15 seconds, Response Time: 45 seconds)
 I want to tell you the event happened, when I was high school student. For the first time in my life, I became a leader of class. I hoped that our class make to popular class in our high student. I tried to do my best anything I could. There was a upcoming sport contests in our school. I prepared strategically the contest to make our class win in Soccer and baseball. I let our class practice soccer for men and basket ball for women every day until the contest. Finally, I participated in the contests each exercise and our class get the second and third among the teams which participated in the contest. I did my best to win the contest as a leader of the class.  

### Question 2
**Some people think it is more fun to spend time with friends in restaurants or cafés. Others think it is more fun to spend time with friends at home. Which do you think is better? Explain why.**

Answer (Preparation Time: 15 seconds, Response Time: 45 seconds)
I usually spend my spare time at home with my friends because I have a stingy personal property. Actually, we don't need to waist of time and money. To gather some place like cafes, we take a time to go there. And We also order the the any food to stay cafe and restaurant as a station fee?. In front of my view, expenditures for date with friend take many part of my pocket money. Sometimes I and friends can sleep over the day together. By doing homework together and doing some project with teamwork, we continuously do something without any interferences. For these reasons I prefer to hang out at home. 

### Question 3
** Read the following text and the conversation that follows it. Then, answer the question. The Northfield College Student Association recently decided to make a new purchase.Read the following announcement in the college newspaper about the decision. (Reading time in an actual test would be 45-50 seconds.)

Good News for Movie Fans
The Student Association has just purchased a new sound system for the Old Lincoln Hall auditorium, the place where movies on campus are currently shown. By installing the new sound system, the Student Association hopes to attract more students to the movies and increase ticket sales. Before making the purchase of the new equipment, the Student. Association conducted a survey on campus to see what kind of entertainment students liked best. Going to the movies ranked number one. “Students at Northfield College love going to the movies” said the president of the Student Association, “so we decided to make what they already love even better. We’re confident that the investment into the sound system will translate into increased ticket sales.”

Listening
(Male student) I really think the Student Association made a bad decision.
(Female student) Really? Why? Don’t you like going to the movies?
(Male student) Sure I do. But this new purchase is just a waste of money.
(Female student) What do you mean? It’s supposed to sound really good.
(Male student) Yeah, well, I’m sure it does, but, in Old Lincoln Hall? I mean that building must be 200 years old! It used to be the college gym! The acoustics are terrible.
(Female student) So you’re saying there’ll be no improvement?
(Male student) That’s right. And also, I seriously doubt that going to the movies is the number one social activity for most students.
(Female student) Yeah, but that’s what students said.
(Male student) Well, of course that’s what they said. What else is there to do on campus?
(Female student) What do you mean?
(Male student) I mean, there isn’t much to do on campus besides go to the movies. If
there were other forms of, uh recreation, or other social activities, you know, I don’t think
most students would have said that going to the movies was their first choice.

** ### Question: The man expresses his opinion of the Student Association’s recent purchase. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
The reading states that Student Association purchased a new sound system for auditorium. They expect that students will love more watching movies then before.
The man's opinion is that Association made a bad decision. He provides two reasons that opposite the reading passage. 
First, The man think that purchasing the new sound system is waste of money. He refute that the build used  movies should be changed college gym. Second, He thinks that Association should seek another ways to satisfy student like recreation for the students who don't like movie. 
That's why the man opposite to install a new sound system for auditorium. 

### Question 4
** Read a passage from a psychology textbook and the lecture that follows it. Then answer the question. (Reading time in an actual test would be 45-50 seconds.)

Reading
Flow                         
In psychology, the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity is called flow. People who enter a state of flow lose their sense of time and have a feeling of great satisfaction. They become completely involved in an activity for its own sake rather than for what may result from the activity, such as money or prestige. Contrary to expectation, flow usually happens not during relaxing moments of leisure and entertainment, but when we are actively involved in a difficult enterprise, in a task that stretches our mental or physical abilities.

Listening
(Male professor) I think this will help you get a picture of what your textbook is describing. I had a friend who taught in the physics department, Professor Jones, he retired last year. . . . Anyway, I remember . . . this was a few years ago . . . I remember passing by a classroom early one morning just as he was leaving, and he looked terrible: his clothes were all rumpled, and he looked like he hadn’t slept all night. And I asked if he was OK. I was surprised when he said that he never felt better, that he was totally happy. He had spent the entire night in the classroom working on a mathematics puzzle. He didn’t stop to eat dinner; he didn’t stop to sleep . . . or even rest. He was that involved in solving the puzzle. And it didn’t even have anything to do with his teaching or research; he had just come across this puzzle accidentally, I think in a mathematics journal, and it just really interested him, so he worked furiously all night and covered the blackboards in the classroom with equations and numbers and never realized that time was passing by.

** ### Question: Explain flow and how the example used by the professor illustrates the concept.
Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
The article is about the concept of flow in psychology. The passage explains that flow is the feeling of completed and energized focus in an activity. 
The professor provides an example of the concept of flow from his real experience. 
He introduces the example of flow through his friend's experience. His friend encountered the some puzzles that are difficult and might took a long time to solve. So he took all time without food and sleep just concentrated on the puzzle. He was surprised after observing the phenomena. He awared that this is the flow phenomena in real life. 
And so, this example clearly illustrates flow which is stated in reading passage can be observed in our lives. 

### Question 5
** Read the following conversation between two students and then answer the question.
(Female student) How’s the calculus class going? You’re doing better?
(Male student) Not really. I just can’t get the hang of it. There’re so many functions and formulas to memorize, you know? And the final . . . It’s only a few weeks away. I’m really worried about doing well.
(Female student) Oh . . . You know, you should go to the tutoring program and ask for help.
(Male student) You mean, in the Mathematics building?
(Female student) Ya. Get a tutor there. Most tutors are doctoral students in the math program. They know what they’re talking about, and for the final test, you know, they’d tell you what to study, how to prepare, all of that.
(Male student) I know about that program . . . but doesn’t it cost money?
(Female student) Of course. You have to register and pay by the hour . . . But they’ve got all the answers.
(Male student) Hmm . . .
(Female student) Another option, I guess, is to form a study group with other students. That won’t cost you any money.
(Male student) That’s a thought . . . although once I was in a study group, and it was a big waste of time. We usually ended up talking about other stuff like what we did over the weekend.
(Female student) But that was for a different class, right? I’ve actually had some pretty good experiences with study groups. Usually students in the same class have different strengths and weaknesses with the material . . . if they’re serious about studying, they can really help each other out. Think about it.

** ### Question: Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.

Answer (Preparation Time: 20 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
The man's problem is that he can't follow up the calculus class at all. he thinks the class is difficult for him.
The students discuss two solutions, the first is taking a tutoring programs and ask for help and the second is making a study group with other students.
If I were the man, I would choose the second solution
The 1st isn't good because I experienced that real doctoral students were not actively helping the undergraduate students. They just helped their students within the time and to earn the tuition fee. 
But the 2nd is better option. because you can hang out the more friends and this make you study calculus class enthusiastically to keep the study group. And study group takes over the big responsibilities to help each student. You'll burden stress but your calculus grade will increase. Finally you can learn various techniques for the problems from each member. 

### Question 6

Listening  
(Female professor) Human beings aren’t the only animals that use tools. It’s generally recognized that other animals use tools as well . . . use them naturally, in the wild, without any human instruction. But when can we say that an object is a tool? Well, it depends on your definition of a tool. And in fact, there are two competing definitions—a narrow definition and a broad one. The narrow definition says that a tool is an object that’s used to perform a specific task . . . but not just any object. To be a tool, according to the narrow definition, the object’s gotta be purposefully changed or shaped by the animal, or human, so that it can be used that way. It’s an object that’s made. Wild chimpanzees use sticks to dig insects out of their nests . . . but most sticks lying around won’t do the job . . . they might be too thick, for example. So the sticks have to be sharpened so they’ll fit into the hole in an ant hill or the insect nest. The chimp pulls off the leaves and chews the stick and trims it down that way until it’s the right size. The chimp doesn’t just find the stick . . . it . . . you could say it makes it in a way. But the broad definition says an object doesn’t have to be modified to be considered a tool. The broad definition says a tool is any object that’s used to perform a specific task. For example, an elephant will sometimes use a stick to scratch its back . . . it just picks up a stick from the ground and scratches its back with it . . . It doesn’t modify the stick, it uses it just as it’s found. And it’s a tool, under the broad definition, but under the narrow definition it’s not because, well, the elephant doesn’t change it in any way.

** ### Question: Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two different definitions of tools given by the professor.

Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
  The professor is talking about the definition of tool. It means human beings as well as animals use the tool from objects.  
According to the professor, there are two examples to clarify the definition of tool giving narrow and broad definition. In narrow definition, objects as a tool have to be modified with a specific task. For example, chimpanzees use a modified stick for digging insects out of the nests. This means stick should be sharpened  to implement specific task compared to sticks laying around in narrow definition. Otherwise, objects as a tool in broad definitions used itself. for example elephant uses any sticks to scrach its back. 
To sum up, we can tell that objects can be a tool with purposely changed for specific task.
