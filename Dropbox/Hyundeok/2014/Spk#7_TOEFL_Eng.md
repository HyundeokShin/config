I bet you all have, at some point, had your personality analyzed… and were amazed at how accurate it was. People that provide these services aren't really psychic, but they do have a gift the ability to read you cold. Et me explain…

### Question 5
M: [agitatedly] I just picked up the new course calendar, and I can't believe my timing!
W: What do you mean? What's the matter with it? 
M: Well you see, I was really looking forward to taking this non-fiction writing course but uh 
W: [interrupting] Let me guess, It was canceled?
M: No but starting this year, it'll only be offered online. I've want to take this course for a long time, but it need seemed to fit my schedule, until now. Finally i;m able to take the course, and it gets moved to the Internet.
W: You know lots of students prefer studying online nowadays.
M: Yeah, but it's just that It doesn't give me the chance to interact with the professor and other students. I'd just be facing a computer screen without any personal communication, I guess.
W: I see what you mean. Well if it's interaction you want, you should think about joining a writing club. There are two very popular ones on campus. I bet you'd get some great ideas there. 
M: I'll consider it, though I'd really like to get course credit for my work.
W: [earnestly] Yeah, you should. And uh.. another option is, since they haven't cancelled the non-fiction course altogether.. Why don't you take it online, and visit the writing professor on a regular basis, to discuss your work in person?

### Question 6

Listening  
Humans have many survival-related concerns, but being hunted and eaten  by a large, sharp-toothed predator isn't usually one of them. Animals, on the other hand, mush constantly stay on guard against bigger, more powerful predators. Evolution has provided them with many methods of self-defense. We will be talking about two of these methods today; camouflage and mimicry.
Very generally, camouflage is a special coloration or another appearance-ralated adoption, which help the animal survive by matching its surroundings. Animals often themselves by sort of blending into their background. Consider the zebra Their striking display of black and white may not seem like good protection. But you know what? A zebra's wavy stripes actually blend in well with wavy lines of tall grass. It doesn't matter that the colors don't match, because the zebra's most dangerous predator, the linen, is colorblind. If a zebra stands still in tall grass, a lion might miss it completely.
Ok, uh, mimicry refers to animals that imitate characteristics of another species to keep predators at bay. Some imitations are so good that it's impossible to tell them apart from the real thing. If weaker animals can deceive predators into thinking they are a thereat or a different animal by mimicking its appearance or sound effects, they might live another day. For example, a certain kind of delicious-tasting butterfly might mimic the orange-and-black wing pattern of another butterfly, which tastes bitter. And, um in doing so it discourages would-be predators who want to stay away form the foul-tasting butterfly.
