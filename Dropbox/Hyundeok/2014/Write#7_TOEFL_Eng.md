Reading passage

Water fluoridation is the act of adding fluoride ions to water in order to reduce tooth decay in the general population. Many municipalities across the world fluoridate their water supplies, citing this practice's effectiveness in reducing tooth decay. 
Water fluoridation is the most effective way to five everybody access to the benefits of fluoride regardless of age, income or education level. Tooth decay occurs when acid destroys the outer surface of the tooth. The acid is produced from sugar by bacteria in the mouth. Fluoride can limit the amount of acid produced, and more importantly can also repair damage before it becomes permanent. A constant supply of low levels of fluoride in the mouth acts like a constant repair Kit for teeth.
Moreover, as with other nutrients, Fluoride is safe and effective when used and consumed properly. Especially, fluoride is listed by the Institute of Medicine's Food & Nutrition Board as a micro nutrient. It is also included on the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Table for phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and fluoride. Through continuous research, drinking optimally fluoridated water has been scientifically proven to be safe (not toxic) and have no adverse effect on bone health. 
Additionally, fluoride provided through water fluoridation does not accumulate over tine in the body causing no adverse bone health effects. After ingestion of fluoride, such as drinking a glass of optimally fluoridated water, the majority of the concentration and than rapidly decline, usually within three to six hours. This decline is due to the uptake of fluoride by the hard tissue, such as bones and teeth, and the efficient removal of fluoride by the kidneys. Evidence of advanced skeletal fluorosis, or crippling skeletal fluorosis, "was not seen in communities in the United States where water supplies contained up to 20 ppm (natural levels of fluoride)


Lecture script 

Some health experts endorse water fluoridation as the single, most effective public health measure to improve oral health. However, recent studies have shown the ineffectiveness of this practice and even potential dangers to people's health. 
 First, it is not clear that water fluoridation is effective to prevent tooth decay. Recent studies conducted in North America show halting fluoridation will either result in only a marginal increase in dental decay which cannot be detected or no increase in dental decay at all. Conversely, the major reasons for the general decline of tooth decay worldwide, both in non-fluoridated and fluoridated areas, are observed in the widespread use of fluoridated toothpaste, improved diets, and overall improved general and dental health. 
 Second, fluoride is not an essential nutrient, which means humans can have perfectly good teeth without fluoride. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now acknowledged the findings of many leading dental researchers that fluoride is beneficial only for the small part of the body, which means teeth, not for the whole body. Thus people don't have to swallow fluoride to protect teeth. As the benefits of fluoride (if any exist) are topical, and the risks are systemic, it makes more sense to deliver the fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of toothpaste than to force people to drink fluoride in their water supply. 
 Finally, fluoride is a cumulative poison. On average, only 50% of the fluoride we ingest each day is excreted through the kidneys. The remained accumulates in our bones, pineal gland, and other tissues. If the kidney is damaged, fluoride accumulation will increase, and with it, the like hood of harm. This fluoride accumulated in the body has the potential to interfere with many hormonal and some neuro-chemical signals. Rats fed for one year with 1 ppm fluoride in their water were found to have morphological changes to their kidneys and brains an increased uptake of aluminum in the brain and the formation of mineral deposits characteristic of Alzheimers disease. 

The lecturer has not a positive opinion for fluoridation of public water by stating some side effects of fluoridation. 
Although reading firstly stated fluoridation reduce tooth decay, lectures opposed the preventing of tooth decay. Because It’s not a major reason by comparing in non-flouradation and fluoridation. Using fluoridated toothpaste enough prevent tooth decay in non-flouradation region. 

Secondly, in view of nutrition of fluoride is not an essential nutrient. Even reading passage insist that fluoride is included DTR table, some findings tell that fluoride is not mainly affect body systems. So They think that it don’t need to swallow directly for preventing tooth decay unnecessarily 

Final point of reading passage is that fluoride will not accumulated in the body with ingesting by kidney. But lecturer provides different opinion that 50% of fluoride is excreted through the kidneys. So in case kidney is damaged fluoridation accumulation will increase. Some experiment with a rat which fed 1ppm fluoride for one year concluded that accumulated fluoride has side effect on their brain and kidneys. 

So because above the reasons, lecturer provide the opinion that flouridation water for reducing the tooth decay is not necessary absolutely based on above the reasons. 

### Question 2
 A person you know is planning to move to your town or city. What do you think this person would like and dislike about living in your town or city? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.

Our city has some of advantages for the people who hasn’t a car. And there are many convenient facilities near the our city such as Super market, Department within for walking area. There are more specific reasons why I recommend you to live here.

Sometime when I feel weak, I have gone to the sport center to swim with my son. As I’m doing these activities, my life is better than I live the another city before. 

Secondly, my city is calm and not complex in highway or the mall. I lived the city that was having congestion in the road and crowed I felt busy and in a hurry  every moment just to get my house. Compare to the city I lived before, There isn’t congestion in the road and department are not crowed with customers. So I’m always relaxed and can have enough time to do whatever I want Finally, I want to introduce the people who are living in our city. Our city people like to enjoy their hobby with a small group periodically. For example, I have joined soccer group and we play soccer game twice a month on weekends. Aside from enjoy the hobby, we also help to discuss the problems to fine the solution each other. These activity made us build  intimate relationship each other who are living in the same city. 
I already stated the specific reasons why our city is good to live, I lived the city for 10 year in the my city without any big inconvenient. I strongly recommend you to live our city for a long time. You are not going to regret your choice to live our city.

It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Answer (30 minutes, 300 words)

This has been a controversy dispute since the small market is more decrease. I agree with building a large shopping center based on below reasons. 

Firstly, It is well known that large shopping center that has large parking area is convenient to shop things that customers want. Theses days, most people has own their car and use the car to go anywhere. Small market hasn’t enough parking area for customer and market is outdoor compare to large shopping center. Since these disadvantage of small market, it is better to build a large shopping center in our neighborhood. 

Secondly, using the large shopping mall isn’t limited for the time of selling. Most of large shopping mall keep sale all day until midnight while the small market is usually closed the store early night. This unlimited time for sale to customer is convenient for the one who had finished their work. After the work at late time, they can purchase the groceries to eat tonight. 

Finally, after the building a large shopping center, we are looking for another building like a movie theater or cafe road. Many people will use the large shopping center and the regions around center will crowd. This will lead to build another facilities like movie theater for them and like a cafe will be build. These effects to grow our city’s economy and our neighborhood will be wealth to buy selling and hiring to the large shopping center. 

Thus building a large shopping center in our neighborhood will positively effect on our city as I mentioned above. Even other side effect that small market is going to reduce of this will generated, the positive effect on the city will be bigger than side effect.
