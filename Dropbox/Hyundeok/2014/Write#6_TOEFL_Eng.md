Reading passage
For more than decade, orbiters and landers have assaulted Mars. Now, scientists have pulled the results, together in the most comprehensive look yet at what the rocks and minerals on the red planet are saying about the possibility of life on Mars. The evidence of life on Mars the scientists suggest includes three things - methane meteorite and water. 
As methane cannot persist in the Martian atmosphere for more than a few hundred years, its presence suggests that it is being replenished by some kind of methane-producing bacteria, similar to some existing on Earth that are metabolizing carbon-dioxide and hydrogen, and producing methane. 
As for the meteorite, several scientists recently announced that they had found evidence of ancient, fossilized, microscopic life from a Martian meteorite. The researchers have found that the magnetite crystals embedded in the meteorite are arranged in long chains, which they say could have been formed only by living organisms. In other words, the meteorite could not be formed without the involvement of living organisms. Their findings are based on the comparison of the Martian meteorite that has magnetic crystal that might contain bacteria, and the meteorite found in Antarctica, which also contains bacteria. 
Also it has now been established that for a billion years large quantities of water have flowed on Mars. NASA's 2003 exploration Mission whose purpose was to look for evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars discovered signs of hydrogen. Hydrogen is present in water and all organic compounds. NASA scientists believe there are water deposits or reservoirs underneath the planet that might form a present-day habitat for life. 


Lecture script 

Okay, Humm Are there locations on Mars where life could exist? Unfortunately, well, at least for now, of course, direct evidence is not available. However, it is generally conceivable that environment  on Mars are so hostile to life that organisms cannot survive there. Even though we have no decisive evidence to prove or disprove. Living organisms on Mars, you know, there are some good reasons to cast doubt on the argument that, uh there are living things on our red neighbor.
First, some scientists see that methane on Mars can be evidence of life on the planet. However, we need to notice that methane can be produced in not only biological but also non-biological ways, I mean, like volcanic eruption. Also, in 2005, two NASA scientist once reported that they had found strong evidence of present life on Mars. They claimed that the methane signatures found in Mars's atmosphere resemble the methane production of some forms of primitive life on themselves backed off from their initial assertions. 
Now, Let's turn to the question of the meteorite. Even though some researchers argue that they have discovered compelling evidence that the magnetite crystals in the Martian meteorite are of biological origin, this has yet to be determined with certatinty. Well, let me tell you briefly about the history of the meteorite It remained on the Martian surface until about 16 million years ago, when an asteroid impact ejected some of the rock, I mean, a meteorite, into space. And, uh after drifting through interplanetary space for millions of years, eventually the meteorite collided with Eart, uh about 13 thousand years ago. The central question is that, " Can meteorites carry living organisms between planets?" Unfortunately, no direct evidence for the transfoer of living organisms between planets is currently available.
Finally, there is no definite evidence for water, either. In March 206, astronomers announced some signs of hydrogen discovered in the valleys of Mars were very simiar to those discovered on the Moon where no living things have been found.
