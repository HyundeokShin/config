W:Oh. I supposed it could make writing papers easier.
M: Yeah, and another thing is, if we aren't limited to working in the labs or dorms, we 'll be able to concentrate better and get our work done faster. It's so noisy there, so if we work in other quieter parts of campus, we'll be much more productive.

### Question 4

Reading 
Paralanguage
Paralanguage is a form of interaction that includes all non-verbal forms of communication, such as body language and other signals. It is used alongside word con ten, consciously and un consciously, to express emotions and mood. Thus, paralanguage clarifies ambiguities and intentions in spoken and written text. In the modern age, it has also been adapted for electronic communications, including text messages and e-mail.

Listening
The study of paralanguage is a wide field that describes many aspects of human interjection. So, um, why don't I give you a couple of examples to illustrate just how important it is?
Think about something as simple as a wink, a perfect example of a facial expression. It can change the whole meaning of the sentence it accompanies. Also, it can imply an unspoken agreement or secret between two people. For instance, a sales clerk might, uh give you a wink when undercharging you for your purchase. Then, it's clear that you understand each other and that everything's all right. 
Of course, paralanguage is not only used in face-to-face situations. You know, emoticons those smiley faces and their thousands of variants, have worked their way into most of our written and online exchanges, as well. In this case, they help us to avoid misunderstandings, since we can't rely on tone or body language to help us correctly interpret another's intentions. 

Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)  
The reading passage states that paralanguage is another way to express their opinion with other tools. The lecturer provides examples to explain importance of using paralanguage. First, wink is another sign of change their opinion. when the sales clerk give the sign as a wink to the customers, when customer is purchasing the stuff offered low price. The deal is accomplished. Second, When we are using the text message, we usually use the emoticons to express our opinion effectively. This can help receiver to easily understand what sender want and sometimes interesting emoticons also give you to be enjoy. 

### Question 5
Listening
M: [nervously] Should I go to the L.A.D concert? They're my all-time favorite band.. and they're playing a show here in two weeks I've been waiting forever to see them live but tickets well they cost a small fortune, and I'm short on cash fight now…
W: [surprised] But you have a part-time job! What's the problem?
M: Yeap.. It's enough to pay the bills, and I even manage to save some money every month. But,, the thing is, I have to think about huge student debt. I'll have once I graduate. I probably shouldn't spend money on stuff like this.
W: Well, maybe you should miss this concert. Saving money is smart. You never know when you're going to need it for an emergency, like.. What if you lost your job?
M: Maybe I realize it's probably not the wisest thins to do financially, but I still really want to go! This might be L.A.D's last concert tour.
W: If that's the case, then um why don't you put in a few extra shifts at work? That what, you could make enough money to afford the ticket, without dipping into your savings.
M:[uncertainly] Well I guess that's an option.. but I'm already working so much.

Answer (Preparation Time: 20 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
The man's problem is that he want to buy a ticket of his favorite band. But he is hesitate buying a ticket because he also want to saving the money for emergency. Two students are discussing two solutions for man's problems. First, she recommend giving up the this concert. saving money is the best choice for emergency. Also she give another solution is that do extra shifts at work. So after the extra shift, you could make enough money to afford the ticket. If I were him, I would choose the first option, actually I had a experience that when I was in emergency, I spend money I had saved for long time. So I think that it's the first to save money and than you can spend spare money.  

### Question 6
Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two animal defense methods discussed by the professor.
Animals communicate with each other by touch, smell, and sound. however, by far the most prominent means of communication is visual, using two types of cues. The first type, "badges," refer to an animal's special coloring or marketings. They have many purposes, but one of the most obvious is self-defense.. that is, to ward off predatory members of other species. Can you guess some other functions, not related to danger at all? Well, an animal might also flash its badge when… when performing a mating ritual. For example, a male bird's brightly-colored feathers would help him catch the attention of females, who usually interpret highly visible feathers as a sigh of a healthy mate. 
The other visual cue is a "display," which refers to behavior adopted by an animal so uh, as to communicate its intentions. Displays might indicate an animal's willingness to fight or possibly a weakness. For example, wolves and dogs tuck their tails between their legs and lie on their backs to show submission, to um communicate that they mean no harm. You might consider displays to be the animal kingdom;s version of human body language.
