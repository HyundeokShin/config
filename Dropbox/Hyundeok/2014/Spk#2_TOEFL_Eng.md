Answer (Preparation Time: 15 seconds, Response Time: 45 seconds)
  After I had a girl friend, we climbed a mountain which is in near the our region to celebrate the our one hundred days together since we have met. We had been talking everything with each other. When we were climbing mountain, we helped to assist pushing and pulling each other. I had been touched the messages she told about me. She also had appreciated what I did somethings for her. I also expressed that she is the best girl friend I've every met. We climbed the top of mountain and shouted "YaHoo". After defending from that mountain, we ate soup dishes for lunch. 

### Question 2
Some people believe the advent of computers has made human live better. Others say computers have a negative effect on society. Explain with which side you agree and why.

Answer (Preparation Time: 15 seconds, Response Time: 45 seconds)
 I agree with that the advent of computers make people to be convenient to everything. If you imagine the world without computers, it's terrible to live without computer. First, every industry is developed with computers rapidly and the population also increased with increasing productivity of crops due to the computer technology. Second, we avoid a risky situation by using robot made by computer such as radioactivity. we also developed many medicines and machine for human beings. Even though there are some unwanted side effects using computer, computers are so many beneficial to people in the world. 

### Question 3
The man states his opinion on the proposed changes to the cafeterias. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

Reading
Variety Coming to Campus Menus
As anyone who has lived in the dorms knows, dining options leave something to be desired. The Student Council has finally taken action and responded to resident's complaints with a proposal to bring in an additional provider. By allowing another company to set up in campus cafeterias., they hope to offer better service and diversify menus. The Council plans to have the changes in place for next semester's residents. Their efforts are much appreciated by the student body.

Listening
M: I guess it's good that they're trying, but I think they're just wasting their time. 
W: Why would it be a waste of time? Don't you think a wider selection of dishes for lunch and dinner would be kind of nice?
M: Sure, it'd be great, but I just don't think their approch'll work. The cafeteria is so cramped as it is. There's just not enough room in there for two companies. And seating is already limited, too. I mean, have you tried to find a seat during dinner? With all the food, there'll be no room for the students. 
W: I guess it is a little tight in there
M: And how they expect to have this program up and running so soon is beyond me. If they gave themselves a little more time, the idea would be a little more plausible. But the next semester, is what? 2 months away?
That's barely enough time to accept bids form other companies, and definitely not enough to make all the others arrangement.

Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
 The reading passage state that student council are going to set up new company in cafeteria. The man's opinion is that setting up new company is waste of time. he provide two reasons for that. First, spare space is lacking now in cafeteria, Now many student had a trouble to find available seat at lunch time. Second, There are barely enough time to prepare new company for two months. It takes more time to set up company. 

### Question 4
Reading 
 The system that people use to make decisions it is often based on personal preferences, not facts. Research in the field of decision-making has found that how the choices are framed, or presented, can have a great effect on the choices made. Generally, people are risk adverse. I presented with two identical choices - one offered as a possible gain, the other introduced as a possible loss - people will overwhelmingly choose the possible gain, even though the two are exactly the same. 

Listening
 The professor gives two examples of people making choices. Explain how they are affected by decision framing.
Today, I'd like to talk about why we make particular choices and even why boxes are labeled in certain ways. Let me give you a couple of examples that might help clear this up. 
For one, think about a weather broadcast. If the weatherman says that there's a 50% chance of showers, people are likely to take an umbrella. Although the chance of rain is the same either way, people respond differently. 
Now, the second example is an experiment here people had to choose a box of medicine. Both boxes of medicine were identical, except that one was labeled 90% effective and the other 10 % ineffective. If you think about it, both boxes are really saying the same thing., but which one do you think people greatly preferred? That's right, almost everyone preferred the one which said it was 90% effective. 

 Question: 
Answer (Preparation Time: 30 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)
  The reading passage state that when people are decisioning, the are depend on personal preferences. The professor provide a two examples about decision framing. First examples says that If it has a possibility to be like to rain, most of people take an umbrella before people depart their home. This means that people likely to avoid the risk even though the two choices are exactly the same. In the second example There was two labeled boxes of medicine - one is 90% effective and the other 10% ineffective. People overwhelmingly choose the first option. This means almost everyone preferred the the one which said it was 90% effective.  

### Question 5

 Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. Now listen to a conversation between two students. M: Hey, Alice, how's the research position at Dr. Walter's lab? have you done anything exciting yet? W: Hmm let's see i sat in his office and answered his phone. M: I thought he was doing some interesting research. W: He is. And so is the rest of the team, but since I'm only an undergrad bio major, I get stuck typing out the papers and running errands. M: That doesn't sound like much fun. Why don't you try getting a position with another team? You know, one that'll let you be more of a real researcher. W: I was thinking about that, but the semester's already started, so there aren't too many other spaces available. M: Well then what's he like? I mean that you talk with him? W: I guess so, he's pretty easy to get along with.  M: Why don't you speak with him and expelling the situation? W: Perhaps... M: You know… say that you are really interested in his work and want to take a more active role.

Answer (Preparation Time: 20 seconds, Response Time: 60 seconds)  The woman's problem is that she has no good research position in her research group. The students are discussing the two solutions for the problem. First is getting a position with another team. Second is talking with her professor. If I were the female student, I would choose the first option. The second option isn't good, because professor is so busy and even he hardly to take time to consult with his doctoral students. She needs to review the research before she had wanted to do by consulting other professors. It is pretty important to find the research she wanted do. Finally, she also will have a good chance to meet a good professor and many friends. As for she will take a long time to graduate school, she also considers her relationship with others. 
### Question 6
Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two different definitions of tools given by the professor.

In certain professions, as wall as in our daily lives, people need to bring their audience's attention to certain portions of their speech. There are thousands of ways of placing emphasis on the important parts of a given message, but today we're going go focus on two of the most common tools.
I'm sure you have all caught a few minutes of a soap opera at some point in your lives. And you've most likely immediately noticed how overly dramatic the dialogue seems. The writers employ a technique called ex 'exaggeration,' when extravagant language is used to express how extreme a situation is, or magnify how strongly someone might feel. Most of the time, it's not meant to be taken literally. For instance, if a woman had just taken along walk, and said, " I can't take another step!" we would assume she could actually still walk, but that she's tired.
A technique on the opposite end of the spectrum is 'understatement,' when the true meaning is more implied than explicitly stated. I'll give you an example from my own life… I was at my friend Ed's house the other day for dinner. And I should mention that he is an excellent cook, and well-known for his dinner parties. After the meal, I commented with a smile, "um not bad " He's heard his food's delicious thousands of times, and i'm sure he's bored with the same compliment over and over again. But he knew what I  meant, and was flattered, even though I didn't say how wonderful is was explicitly.
