Reading passage
The concept of the multinational corporation is a long-established one, dating from the early `17th century. However, the number of these companies, that have branches or franchises in multiple countries, has dramatically increased post-World War 2. This ability to span the globe benefits consumers in numerous and varied ways.
Multinationals' cost decrease as a result of economics of scale from increased output. They pass those saving on to their customers, resulting in prices that reflect their reduced costs. Price are also lowered due to global competition among firms, an effect that wouldn't be possible with only local companies.
Another advantage to consumer is that multinationals allow access to an increased selection of products. No longer are populations limited to the itemed produced locally, but instead, can chose among products from all over the world. In addition to a wider variety, companies with world-wide search offer high-quality goods regardless of the consumers' location. Well-known brands guarantee a well-made product, no matter where it is purchased. 
Lastly, multinationals help local economies as they open offices and factories overseas. They provide employment for local workers, raising income and thus, improving the local consumers' standard of living, especially in those areas involved in production. They provide local economic new opportunities to grow and develop when they introduce new technology and train the workers in new skills. In turn, this promotes economic stability. 

Lecture script 
Let begin today by posing the question, are multinationals as positive as they would have us believe? well, that's a complicated issue but we can begin by looking at some recently taken surveys.
OK, the first questions dealt with their effects on populations. Responders side that although they cut costs and thrive, in reality, it's rare that multinationals pass saving onto consumers. In fact, they're accused of going to the other extreme. What I mean by this is monopoly, which results in higher prices and lower quality. Another point mentioned was the high price that comes with the availability of multinationals of being main cause of homogenization across the globe. people everywhere all have to buy same things, as local products become unavailable. In other words, diverse, remarkable cultures all begin to resemble each other. 
We should also consider some of the comments made about their impact on local economics. Uhm... some survey-takers actually said that they destroyed them. They no other choice but to work for multinationals, even though they don't enforce labor standards, and often, don't pay their employees enough. Many people expresses that these companies simply don't care about the areas or people they exploit.

The lecturer point out the side effects of multinationals with the survey. 
The first things he pointed that monopoly will be happened.  At initial time, multinationals decrease the cost of product and increase the quality of it to take a market share. This will be the cause of reducing small company. After small company go bankrupt, multinationals will be remained alone and they will increased the prices and supply lower quality of product without any competition with other company. 

Secondly, he provide that customer will buy same things across the globe. This indicate that local products will disappear and there isn’t any characteristics reflected the local region. Multinationals just make the same product in one region to reduce the production cost and deliver the product to all over the world.
