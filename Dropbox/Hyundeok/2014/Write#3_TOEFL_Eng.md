Reading passage 
Cancer is the third highest cause of death among all diseases. Surprisingly, people in particular countries are more prone to certain types of cancer. The main reason for this is genetic factors, that is, traits passed down from generation to generation. There are a few groups that demonstrate that cancer is here dietary particularly well. Research shows that Japanese men are seven times more likely to get stomach cancer than American men. On the other hand, Japanese men are five times less likely to suffer from prostate cancer than Americans. 
They have the lowest rates of contracting any form of cancer compared to all other ethnic groups in the United States. These two examples clearly show that it is heredity that causes the discrepancy in cancer rates among different nationalities. 

Lecture script 
Many scientists have dedicated their lives to figuring out cancer's causes. Today, we're going to look at cancer incidence in two ethic groups, and identify relevant factors. 
All right, let's take a look at Japanese men. They are especially susceptible to stomach cancer. Researchers now theorize that this can be reached to their lifestyle. Their food is mostly fish dishes and other pickled or smoked foods, which can lead to cancer. A study of Japanese immigrants' and their counterparts in Japan confirmed this. It's found that those who took on the American diet were less likely to get stomach cancer. Those who stated in Japan, however, remained at high risk.
Another group that shows how environmental factors affect cancer rates are the Native Americans. They historically have had lower cancer rates then all other ethnicities in the US, but scientists claim this is due to their diet, not genetics. They have a history of using pants and herbs rich in natural medicines. For examples, Native Americans often consume this specific root that is rich in chemicals that attack cancer cells in the body. 

### Question 1
Summarize the points made in the lecture, explaining how they cast doubt on the points made in the reading passage.
Answer (20 minutes, 155~225 words)

The reading passage states that a person who is prone to cancer are caused from the genetic factors.
The lecturer refutes that the cause of cancer incidence is due to their diet by giving an example research. Japanese who immigrated to America is not willing to get stomach cancer due to American diet based on their research. This research means that factors of causing stomach cancer is depends on their diet not on genetic factors. But incidence of prostate cancer will be increased due to changed American diet. 
Secondly, the lecturer insists that environmental factors affect cancer incidence in Native Americans. For example, Americans historically have had the pants and herbs which prevent the stomach cancer. So they have a lower cancer rate than all other ethnicities. From this findings, cancer rate doesn’t depend genetic factors rather than on their diet.  
In conclusion, contrarily reading passage, the lecturer provides the findings that cause of caner rate is not genetic factors rather than it is resulting from their environmental factors and their diet. 

### Question 2
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Answer (30 minutes, 300 words)
How much time do you spend watching a television a day? Actually, most leisure or taking a break times are consumed by watching television for many people. They feel relaxed from the heavy stress that they get from company life. The problem is that this is continuously repeated. As a result, we have a meaningless lifestyle by watching a television for many times with below regions. 
First, television makes people not to likely do anything likes social activity, because watching a television is so convenient compared to other activity. So even if people have an appointment in advance, they easily cancel the appointment due to watching a television in series. They are not willing to hang out with friends or family. 
Second, watching a television let people be addicted by watching a series of TV shows likes drama and season movie. From my experience,  I watched the drama which is composed the series of more than 10, I just addicted on the watching a that drama. I can’t do anything because of the my curiosity of next story of the drama. I had watched the all series of the drama for all day. 
Finally, talking stories with friend and family frequently will be about dramas or television programs. So we can't talk more serious or sincere topics with friends and family. This is the because they spend their time to watching a drama and their life focused on the story of drama. If they will interest in the book or volunteer works, their’s talking is more meaningful between them of life.
In conclusion, I disagree that people spend watching a television a day. But they can watch for short time for relaxing their stress.
