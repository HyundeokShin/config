Statue of University founder
The university board has approved the plan to erect a statue of the school's founder near the main administration building. Not only will this remind students of the accomplished scholar who dedicated his life to the pursuit of higher education, but it will also reinforce the university's reputation as one of the oldest educational institutions in the country. A $50  fee will be changed to each student's account to raise the necessary funds. 
Listening
M: What a waste.. If they want to spend money on something just for show, the school should pay for the whole thing. Our tuition is high enough as it is.
W: Actually, I don't mind so much. I mean, it's only a few dollars each semester.
M: Yeah, but The university can increase its prestige by investing in its students, not in expensive monuments. You know? I mean, I'd rather see that money go to new facilities, like computers for the lab, instead of to commemorate someone I've ever met.
W: I see... you're saying that if they're going go increase our fees, it should be for something more meaningful, right?
M: Exactly, Besides, there are already things on campus in his name. The Arts and Sciences library, which was named after him, not to mention that huge portrait in the administration building It's just that I don't think we really need another reminder.

Sleep learning
Every animal sleeps; however, sleep's biological role has remained a mystery until recently. New research has shown that sleep plays a critical role in the formation of memories. While asleep, the brain consolidates the information received during the day and converts it into a more permanent form. Without this mechanism for storing information, the brain is unable to retain details and skills long term, limiting learning and skill acquisition.
Listening
Now listen to the part of lecture on this topic in a neuroscience class.
Many consider sleep to be a waste of time. Some of you, I bet, stay up all night studying for exams, thinking it's better than getting some rest. But recent experiment show that may not be true. 
Let me describe one particular study, one that examined how sleep affects simple motor skills. Researchers asked people to type a simple combination of numbers, like " 4123" on a keyboard, and after a few minutes of practice, measured how quickly and accurately the subjects typed this sequence. one group was tested in the morning and retested later that day. The other was tested in the evening and then retested the next morning, after getting a good night's sleep. The results were truly surprising. Even though the same amount of time had elapsed, the people that didm;t sleep well didn't improve. But those that slept for a full 8 hours improved by as much as 20 present in their speed, and 50 percent in accuracy. See the difference that sleep makes!

### Question 5
Now listen to a conversation between two students
M: Final exams are coming up quickly.. Wow I just can't believe the school year's almost over!
W:[resigned] I know but I'm ready really dreading exam week. You know, I'm tempted to just skip my political science final to make it easier for myself.
M: What? You mean not take it at all? What about your final grade?
W: The thing is, I've been struggling in that class all semester… Even if I do well on the test, I'm pretty sure I'll fail the course. I wish there was some way…
M: But missing the final would hurt your standing even more Why don't you ask your professor if you can do an extra-credit assignment to boost your grade, like some type of paper or something ?
W:[surprised] You think that's possible? But I don't know if he could make an exception just for em. ..
M: Who know? It's worth a shot. Or, you might want to appeal to the administration about dropping that course without a grade penalty, even thought  it's past the drop date. I hear they make allowances in extreme circumstances. You'd have to given them a really good excuse though
W: Interesting Hmmm, I didn't know that was possible either….

### Question 6
Now listen to part of a talk in a management class.
Today, let's continue discussing leadership styles. There are two types, transactional and transformational. 
A transactional leader works within his organization to accomplish specific goals… So, a boss depends on rewards and punishments to make sure that his staff completes those tasks. basically, the workers know that they've got to do their jobs in order to get paid, or they'll be fired. Because of this hierarchical relationship, a transactional leader in a meeting probably wouldn't ask for others opinions or make any drastic chafes in the way things are done. Instead, this manager would just assign takes to everyone, and expect them to be ready by their deadlines.
Now, that's quite different from a transformational leader, who tends to focus less on short-term goals, but more on a greater vision. Well, he motivates his staff menders differently, by infecting them with his own enthusiasm and.. uniting them in a mission to improve the organization as a whole. Because of this dynamic, a transformational leader can depend on his staff's commitment to the vision. In return for their hard work,s the workers don't just get paid… they also gain a sense of fulfillment. Let's see here If a transformational leader were to call a meeting, he might emphasize creativity and encourage everyone to do their best.
