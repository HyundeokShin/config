Reading passage
Smart cars are a much needed economical and fuel-efficient transportation option in an age when clogged highways and skyrocketing fuel costs are salient social concerns. With the price of gasoline soaring in the US, people can no longer afford to buy vehicles with low gas mileage. As a result, American consumers are embracing smart cars that boast fifty to sixty miles per gallon.
Another advantage of smart cars is their small and streamlined size, which makes them easier to maneuver in crowed cities and reduces traffic congestion. They are about half the size of mid-size cars, meaning roads could potentially accommodate twice the number of divers with little or no increase in congestion.
Finally, they are safer than other vehicles. Smart car drivers cannot go faster than 85 miles per hour, and thus are involved in fewer accidents caused by reckless or hight-speed driving. Moreover, in collisions, smart cars also react differently because they have been designed with a safety-cage that holds its shape in accidents, much like the crash-cage of race car.

Lecture script
So ah… Smart cars have been boosting consumers' hopes of reducing fuel coasts and doing something positive for the environment. Now, we're going to see whether smart cars lived up to that optimism a year after they came out. 
Well first of all, smart cars are not very fuel efficient.. at least, not as much as manufacturers claim they are. The 60 mile-pre-gallon claim that's been promised is actually more like 37, as shown in actual tests. This ranks a lackluster ninth among all cars. So promises about saving fuel costs sen pretty empty. 
As for the effects of smart cars on traffic congestion.. did you know that , historically, the number of vehicles on the road increases after the introduction of new model? Look at the SUB boom. We also saw this happen with smart cars, which seat only two passengers. So people had to un sue more automobiles to seat the people what previously fit in one saran. So the introduction of smart cars actually worsened congestion. 
And believe it or not, the smart car cuteness can be deadly… that's because they might be too small for their own good. Other drivers tend to have more trouble seeing smart cars clearly, and often sidewise them. So um even smart car owners admitted they felt unsafe driving next to large vehicles on the road. In accidents, smart cars were the ones that, umm got crushed. So their hight accident rate has also added to consumer's misgivings about this so-called miracle automobile.

### Question 1
 Summarize the points made in the lecture, explaining how they cast doubt on the points made in the reading passage.
Answer (20 minutes, 155~225 words)

The reading passage insists that smart car is beneficial to current transportation with three reasons that are fuel-efficiency, reducing congestion and safety. 
Otherwise, the lecturer is opposite in taking smart car for current transportation with three opposite reasons. 
First, fuel-efficiency of smart is unreasonable based on in actual teats. Although manufacturer claims that fuel-efficiency is the best among current cars, it is one of way to promote the smart car.  Fuel-efficiency is need to be developed with a long time. 
Secondly, congestion problem is not effectively solved by smart cars. Even thought most smart cars are small, if then smart car spreads, the number of car also increased. Unlikely reading passage the congestion will be serious. 
Finally, safety is most important matters for all. Whereas smart car is not faster than other cars, the safety of car is not guarantee their safety due to lightness and small. As well as some drivers tell their experience that they were sacred and felt unsafe when they are driving beside on the road with large car such as track.
In conclusion, a smart car is not always good for transportation. In others side of advantages there also are many side effects that lectures claimed.
