Reading passage
 It used to be that parents took their children on vacation during the summer, when school was out of session. But today, much more often than in the past, many parents take their children on vacation during the school year. Although these children are away from school, sometimes for several weeks, traveling itself serves a valuable educational function. 
The most important educational benefit of taking children on vacation is that traveling exposes children to new places and cultures. It is good for children to students learn by meeting the people and absorbing the culture of these places is something they could not learn in their classrooms. 
Moreover, the benefits to the children who have been away from the classes. Students who are in school ever day of the school year can easily lose enthusiasm for their studies. But students invigorated by time away return with heightened excitement. 
The trend of students taking vacation during the school year also has benefits for teachers. When these students return to school, their knowledge and enthusiasm contribute positively to the entire class. Teachers can ask the children to share stories of their peers and can incorporate what they have learned from traveling into writing and reading projects. This makes lesson development easier for teachers because the returning students' experiences provide a ready basis for classroom discussions and projects.


Lecture script 
Now, Let's consider how taking children on vacation when school is in session impacts their education. I believe the impact on children and their teachers can be quite negative. 
While students have been traveling, their fellow students have been working. What do you think happens when they return to school? Well, they have to spend a lot of time "Play catch-up," you know, doing work that fellow students have already done. It's one thing to miss a day or two of school, but many parents take their up that much missed time. So, the missed learning has to be weighted against the benefits of traveling and learning about other cultures. On balance, what is lost greater than what is gained. 
When children come back to class after a long trip, they're exited about their recent adventures. Sounds good, but this enthusiasm can be downside. Their excitement can make it difficult for them to fit back into the routine of the school day. School seems a little boring to them, so they're not attentive to their studies, and their restlessness can distract other students. 
 When a student is distracted or has to catch up on missed work, there's negative effect on the teacher too. Teachers have lesson plans that detail, day by day, what they are going to teach. When a student is absent from the classroom, this interferes with a teacher's plan for that student. And if teachers spend time helping a few students catch up, they have less time for other students so they suffer too. 

### Question 1 
 Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passage.

The passage points out that taking children on vacation in school year is beneficial for them. But the lecture opposites the passage by giving following reasons. 
Firstly, catch-up problem will be generated. Some students who took on vacation had missed classes. This makes unbalance situation among students. For example, the student who took on vacation will have more burden task or work to catch-up the classes he had missed. It might be solved by themselves.
Second, although the student who took on vacation let off steam on, their feeling of state isn’t well applied to have a class. Some of them might be distracted from vacation and they might not easily focus on class. This also might affect to other students when they are taking a class. 
Finally, as well as student, teacher can’t also focus on their class Because some of students were absent. Their teacher might has a trouble in teaching a student with same materials. The teacher helps the student who took on vacation by making up classes. 


### Question 2
It has recently been announced that a new movie theater may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. Answer (30 minutes, 300 words)

I’m agree to build a theater in our neighborhood. I have thought that building a theater  around us has many advantages as following the reasons. 
Firstly, it’s will bring economy effects on our region. After the building a theater, our neighborhood can sell the many things such as popcorn, coffee, hamburger to the people who are going to see movie. These activity make us to do economic activity for them. Employment’s rate will increase on our region. 
Secondly, movie theater will induce to construct others buildings like a cloth shop, restaurants, .etc. This region will attract more people who live around the regions and they who visited our region will spend more money buying or eating something. 
Finally, transportation will increase on our region by building a theater. This is another advantage for our region. If you traffic continually increase by the people who get to theater, the city governor will plan to extend the road to solve the traffic jam. We can look forward to develop our city by governor’s investment.
