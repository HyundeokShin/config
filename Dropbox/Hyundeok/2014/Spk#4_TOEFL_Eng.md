Announcement from the University President
Effective immediately, Frye University will begin cutting funds for its grants and scholarships. The funds taken financial assistance will go toward campus renovations and equipment upgrades. The university feels this will benefit all students, and not just the recipients of finical awards. Only those students with extreme needs will be eligible for financial aid from the university. Applications from medium or low need students will no longer be considered. 

Listening
M: Lucky for me, I got a grant before they started considering this new policy. Do they really think this will help student?
W: You know what? I think it will, The school has the right to allocate its money as it sees fit. as long as it benefits as many studnet can use… like new lab equipment, library books, and improvements to the student center.
M: OK hmm, but what if you want to go to summer school and need financial assistance. but are not poor enough to qualify for a grant?
W: Look if your grades are good, you can still apply for a grant from the government , the same way you would at school. The only difference is, the money comes from the government instead.

### Question 4

Reading 
Alternative Fuels 
Today, we are in search of an alternative to fossil fuels to power our civilization, but it must fit certain conditions. One requirement is that it must be cost-effective. The amount of fuel available is very important because the more that exist, the cheaper it will be. Moreover, the next fuel must be environmentally friendly. It must be clean burning, so as to minimize harmful chemicals that pollute the air.

Listening
As you already know, we need another energy source for the future, for after the fossil fuels run out hydrogen is becoming quite a popular option.
One of the reasons it's favored is that it's renewable… That is, there's an infinite supply. Hdrogen is actually one of the most plentiful element in the universe.. since it's a part of water and of almost all organic matter. 
So unlike the fossil fuels, its price will never increase just because there's only a little left. 
Even more impressive is the fact that hydrogen doesn't emit any harmful byproducts, only water vapor. It doesn't release carbon dioxide, so would reduce air pollution and smog. Another positive effect is that it, um It wouldn't make the greenhouse effect worse, and well it might even reverse global climate change, if used extensively.

### Question 5
Now listen to a conversation between two students
M: Hey, Mary. Want to have lunch together? I've got some free time before my next class.
W:[regretful] Sorry, Alex. but I can't I uh I have to go to the health clinic to get a flu shot. I;m just so worried that I'll get sick this winter.
M: [casually] Everybody gets sick. you shouldn't stress out about it. I mean it's not that big a deal.
W: It is when you don't have insurance and can't go to the doctor because it's too expensive!
M: [comprehendingly] Oh, I see…. That must put a lot of pressure on you to stay healthy. Say, you're not covered by your parent's plan? I heard that if you're under 24 and still a college student, sometimes you can stay on their policy. It'd be dirt-cheap or maybe even free, for you. 
W: That'd ve great, but I'm reluctant to bother my parents with my problems. It's I am an adult now, after all. And I wouldn't want their rates to go up, not even a little. 
M: Well, then you could look into getting yourself a university plan. You know, they have special ones just for college students. They're supposed to be pretty affordable. 
W: Money is just so tight these days. But you're I really should find something, though.

### Question 6
Now listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Continuing our discussion of natural disasters, let's um, look at different methods of measuring earthquakes. First, we'll talk about one based on math and then another based on people's reactions. 
You are probably most familiar with the first method You see, we can measure an earthquake mathematically by determining its magnitude, or how much energy the earthquake released. The magnitudes are arranged on a numeric scale where the higher the number, the more intense the earthquake. According to the scale, earthquake with a rating of 3 or below are, well pretty weak. At the other end of the scale, an earthquake with a rating of 8 or more releases enough energy to cause serious damage across large areas. because it's objective and accurate, this is the most common method used by the media and scientists.
There's also a scale that does not depend on numbers. Rather , it is based on people's reactions to earthquakes. Surveys are taken of people who were in the area when the earthquake took place, and then a level is developed. For example a low ranking earthquake is not felt by anyone on the surface. A high-ranking earthquake can cause objects to fall, walls to crack, and trees to shake. That can be scary.. enough to really affect people. Now, this method is much more subjective because different people have different ideas of what strong is.
