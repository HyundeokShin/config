Plans to expand Library System
Student enrollment and university research projects have been  on the rise. As a results, over-crowding of the library system has become a major concern. The administration feels it can best serve student' needs with one of two alternatives. one plan would be to expand the main library by about 30 percent. The other plan would be to build a new library on a now-empty lot near South Campus. this is the more expensive option but, as with other libraries, the new facility would include a food court, computer lab and lecture hall. 
Listening
W: You might find this hard to believe, but even though i'm going to have to make changes to my schedule. it's kind of a relief. 
M: What do you mean? Don't you think students are busy enough with responsibilities they already have? 
W: Of course, not everyone will be happy about having to volunteer. But I think a lot of people will agree that it's hard to find jobs after graduating. Just imagine It's even harder if you've never worked in the industry you're trying to get into. So with this So, this program,I can make connections at companies that I'm interested in, or at least try to volunteer somewhere that's related to my field. 
M: Okey, that's true. Just studying while we're in school isn't enough; we need something like real-world experience. 
W: Yes. Plus, at the same time, students who would normally spend all their time studying can balance school with interesting volunteer work. I think volunteering would teach students about themselves, and maybe even help them to become better people by you know, by teaching them how to donate their time and talents to help others.

Language-Acquisition Theories
Contemporary language learning theories constitute one of the most controversial issues - "Nature versus Nurture" - in linguistics today. Those who support the "nature" theory believe that humans are endowed with natural language-learning abilities. They believe that there is a dedicated language-acquisition device in our brains, one that contains all the parameters of language is learned through one's environment, social conditioning, and family upbringing. Proponents of this theory assert that humans are able to learn languages because we have the time and opportunity through daily interaction todo so.

So those of you that've traveled abroad, or even had contact with immigrants in your home countries, are bound to be familiar with the notion of cultural incongruity, a type of mismatch, I'd say. 
Here's a specific example for you. In many Asian societies, people are taught that it's impolite to look their superiors in the eyes. So, people from those cultures keep their gaze lowered as a sign of respect. But in the States, for example, eye contact isn't considered rude at all. In fact, when two people are engaged in a conversation, it'd be considered rude not to meet the other person's eyes.. that would mean that we're not interested in what they're saying.
Let's look at a more specific case I recently read about. IT's about a Vietnameses girl in a Canadian elementary school. Apparently, a local boy in her class had taken a liking to this girl. He showed her his feelings in ways he's accustomed to, like paying attention to her, and um trying to find ways to be near her… in classes and outside at recess. But she was really embarrassed by this. It turns out, in Vietnam, boys and girls are often taught separately. So, she didn't have much experience interaction with boys, Vietnamese or otherwise. She was, uh extremely uncomfortable with all this attention and didn't know how to react.

### Question 5
M: Hey, Alex. You look terrible!
W: Gee… thanks, Ellen [drowsily, with a yawn] I'm really tired I have a tone of studying to do for midterms, and four papers due next week. on top of that, my boss wants me to work extra hours this week, which I can't refuse.. because I need the money. But I also need time to study and sleep! There just aren't enough hours in the day. 
M: It sounds like you're totally overwhelmed. You know, If you're that tired, you're not going to be very efficient in your studying. You should tell your boss you need to work less until after the exams are over, and .. you can make up the hours later this month. That way, you'll do better on your exams and papers, and you'll still have some money coming in. 
M: My school work really should come first, but I don't know… He only has two other employees; that's not enough staff to cover the schedule. 
W: Well, then .. Hey, what do you usually do at work when there are no customers?
M: Oh, you know, look through catalogs, write emails. that sort of stuff.
W: Okey, how about trying to get some of you studying done instead of wasting all that time? You can review your notes and read. And since there's a computer, you can research your papers!
M: Yeah maybe. but I've got to figure out something ! I don't know how long I can keep this up!

### Question 6

Listening  
Now listen to part of a talk sociology class.
Last week, I introduced group concepts, so today I'd like to talk more in depth about one in particular, stereotyping. When we stereotype - and everyone does it to some extent - we make generalizations about entire groups. This can be done consciously or unconsciously.. let's see based on gender, race religion, or for any number of other reasons. 
Historically, stereotyping was done to justify discrimination against a group of people. Now, right before World War 2, the Nazis were purposely trying to discriminate against the Jews., in by far the most egregious use of stereotypes. They tried to portray jewish people as greedy and untrustworthy, which, of course is not true. But they did it because the German economy was doing so poorly that they needed a scapegoat…. sort of a group of people to blame. Jews were a convenient target because many worked in business and in financial areas. 
Anyway, I think history has shown the damage that this kind of stereotyping is able to inflict.
What about the other type… unconscious? Many common stereotype are based on gender. Even though many people believe that they treat men and women equally, there is still an unintentional bias A good example is with musicians. For a long time, there were always more men than women in orchestras. Perhaps, the a new auditioning method. They had the applicant play behind a screen so that the reviewer wouldn't know if it was a man or woman. Once this method became widespread, many more women were hired. The reason well, uh the unconscious stereotyping by the reviewers had affected their judgment to such a degree that they rated males better musicians when actually, there was no difference.  

### Question: Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two different definitions of tools given by the professor.
