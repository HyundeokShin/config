Protest our gym opening to area residents!
Next semester, the university plans to open its gym to local residents. For a small monthly fee, anyone residing in the country will be able to use the gyms whenever they want. But the university hasn't stopped to consider how this will affect us, the tuition paying students. If anyone can get a membership, the gyms are going to be too crowded. As it is, we often have to wait to use machines. And with all this use, the equipment is going to wear out much faster. I encourage you to write to the Recreational Sports Office, and ask them to put their students first. 

Listening
M: I'm glad that someone else feels the same way as I do about the new policy.
W: Really? I think it's made a definite improvement.
M: Don't you think it makes campus life more difficult? I had to wait 20 minutes today to get into the cafeteria.
W:Well it has made some things inconvenient, but safety is more important than other concerns. 
M: [doubtfully] How … how exactly does  waiting in line help safety?
W: You know, there always used to be a lot of homeless people hanging out in the cafeteria. With so many strangers in there, it was kind of dangerous in the evenings especially if you went there alone.
M: Ok… I see your point there  I guess they had a reason to make the change. 
W: Of course, they did. The professor is way out of line to suggest that we should be offended. If anything, we should be happy that the university is willing to go through the extra time and expense in order to protect us.

### Question 4
Read a passage from a psychology textbook and the lecture that follows it. Then answer the question. (Reading time in an actual test would be 45-50 seconds.)

Reading
Classical Conditioning 
Classical conditioning, also known as respondent conditioning, is a type of learning process often seen in animals, as well as in humans. The theory dictates that if two events frequently occur together, the subject will begin to see them as a pairing and associate one with the other. Therefore, as soon as they sense the independent event, know as stimulus, they will elect the other half of the pair. The stimulus will elicit the appropriate response, which is know as the reflex. 

Listening
Most of you have heard of Pavlov's famous experiments with dogs. Now… He stumbled upon a fascinating phenomenon, which uh illustrates classical conditioning perfectly. 

### Question: The professor describe two observations on the behavior of dogs and humans. Explain how these behaviors are interpreted according to the theory of classical conditioning.

### Question 5
M:Hey, Esther How's your first semesters going? 
W:Actually, it could be better. The schoolwork isn't that bad. but i;m feeling a little out of place here. 
M: [concerned] Oh really Why is that? 
W: Well, I haven't met too many people since school started, an I don't seem to have much in common with those I do meet. I;m finding it hard since I don't seem to have in common with those I do meet. I'm finding it hard since I don't live on campus. May I should've opted for a dorm room. I mean I'd make friends more easily that way.
M: That's not true. Students who live off campus have lot's of friends. too! You should think about joined last year and met tons of new people. 
W: That's not a bad idea, but I'm not sure.. Joining club might interfere with my studies..
M: If time is an issue, then hey why not post an ad on the university;s website? There's a Personals page that includes a section for people who just want to make friends. You could. you know, write about your interests, and describe what kind of friend you want to meet! Then, you can choose from the response that you get. 
W: It's a good idea but hum.. I'll have to give it some thought I've never used the internet to make friends before...

### Question 6

Listening  
Today, we'll be talking about boycott. Ok, a boycott is simply when people refuse to buy, sell or trade with another person, company, or country in order to change some policy… Now, what makes them effective? All right.. it's the scope If enough people get together and decide to do something, then it can have a substantial effect. Let me give you a couple of examples which will clear this up. 
The first example is a really famous one from the Civil Rights struggle in American's South. At the time, the local but company would only allow blacks to sit in the back of the bus. So, all of the black people in the city banded together to boycott the company .. meaning they well refused to take the bus. At first, the company resisted the pressure, but over time, as they began to lose more an more money, they relented and allowed blacks to sit anywhere on the bus. So refusal to use a service force the company to change how it operated. 
The another example I'd like to discuss today was not as successful. Let's see here A small religious group in America tried boycotting a major movie studio, to protest what it felt were offensive movies. They tried to force the studio to make more family-oriented films. Well this group wasn't big enough to affect the studio's profits. So, what do you think happened? That's right nothing The company didn't make any changes because  there.. there weren't enough people boycotting to give it enough of a financial inventive to do so. 

### Question: Using points and examples from the talk, compare the two boycotts describe by the professor.
