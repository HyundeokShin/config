The reading passage states that Nazca lines are made with three purposes, celestial calender, art and navigation. On the other hand, the lecturer refutes the reading passage in three points.

First, Nazca lines can not expect calender events according to the anthropologist's investigation. The previous evidence is more thinker and thiner and it is not enough to explain the all phenomenon of celestial events that the reading passage insisted. Also computer program just revealed the 20% of corresponding with celestial events.  

Seconds, The theory that Nazca lines are drawn for artistic purpose is not also trustable. Because the Nazca lines drawn on the ground is too large and giant to depict the Nazca line into pottery. It also hard to see the Nazca lines because they are drawn on the ground although it is for the artistic purpose.   

Finally, Third theory is lack to support the theory for navigation purpose of traveling in the desert. Monkey tales that drawn on the ground represented a circle. It can not navigate the road on the desert. So this is not for spiritual symbol rather than practical travel.  

All in all, Nazaca lines is still mysterious relic to need to be investigated. The lecture is properly refutes that three theory of Nazca lines' purpose by providing logical statement.
